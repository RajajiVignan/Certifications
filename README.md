 #1. Machine Learning by Stanford Online.
 Tutor: Andrew Ng
It is a 11-week course starting from the basics of R/python to the background Math involved in major algorithms of the Machine Learning. The course is interactive with quizes and codes to practice what's been taught. The primary tool used is Matlab (since it's quite old course). But the theory/concept for the algorithm is basically the same no matter which language you use.
